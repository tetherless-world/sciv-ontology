<h2 id="modelingabout">Ontology Composition</h2>
  <p>The current modelling approach allowed us to create a simple and expandable seven class SCIVO ontology connected with object properties (<a href="#fig1">Figure. 1</a>). This provides a mechanism for users to explore career paths based on their possessed skill proficiency levels. Additionally, the model allows users to investigate the explored career path through multiple resources providing information about the respective career path. </p>
