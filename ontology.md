  <p class="message">Ontology has been cleared for release and is made available as an open-source resource under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a></p>
  <p>We have designed the Skills to Career with Interests and Values Ontology that captures the various career paths a doctorate can take based on their possessed skills. They can then explore those skills using the various available resources and the interests and values the career path requires that matches to their own. We also depict how our ontology schema can support the modeling of data from both Science Individual Development Plan tool - myIDP and the NSF 2019 Doctoral Recipient Survey.</p>
