<h3 id="myidp"> Science Individual Development Plan tool - myIDP </h3>
 <p> We demonstrate the use of SCIVO by designing and ingesting Science Individual Development Plan tool - myIDP data (henceforth refered to as myIDP). We assume that this information could be beneficial for graduate student to explore scientific career paths from the known twenty career paths provided on myIDP.  As a proof of concept, we have integrated one-thousand seven-hundred and forty data points from myIDP as below by extending and intantiating the SCIVO classes.
    <ul>
		<li> Twenty Scientific Career Paths available for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) doctorates with their definitions. </li>
		<li> Broad and fine skills possessed by one </li>
        <li> Interests that one may have </li>
		<li> The proficiency and passion levels of skills and interests required for the twenty scientific career paths as based on the experts avaerage scores.</li>
	</ul>

<h3 id="nsf"> NSF Doctoral Recipients Survey 2019 in Machine Readable form </h3>

 We demonstrated how two heterogeneous resource can be harmonized using SCIVO to help students get a better picture towards making an informed decision by adding sectors from NSF 2019 Doctoral Survey Recipients data.
